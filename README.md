# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this Prework Study Guide to help prepare myself for coding boot camp. It will be used as a space to not only keep notes or track progess but also get used to being in the following environments:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git
I learned the baisc foundations for each of these to grow on.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used to track notes of what I have learned. It currently contains notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. If we open the DevTools console we can see the JavaScript running. This js will list the topics we learned from the prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
